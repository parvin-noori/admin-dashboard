## Admin Panel Project

This admin panel with User Authentication is a result of completing the React course by Classbn. I developed this project using React and Vite. The following libraries and technologies were used in this project:

- **React Hook Form** for form management
- **Lodash** for utility functions
- **React Toastify** for notifications
- **React Router DOM** for routing
- **Context API** for state management
- **i18next** for internationalization
- **Axios** for making API requests

The project supports two languages and includes both dark and light themes.
